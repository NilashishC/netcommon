minor_changes:
  - `NetworkTemplate` and `ResouceModule` base classes have been moved under `module_utils.network.common.rm_base`.
     Stubs have been kept for backwards compatibility. These will be removed after 2023-01-01.
     Please update imports for existing modules that subclass them.
     The [cli_rm_builder](https://github.com/ansible-network/cli_rm_builder) has been updated to use the new imports.
